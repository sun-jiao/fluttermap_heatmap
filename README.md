A full example can be found under the example project.

## Usage

Add [`flutter_map`](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map) and `flutter_map_heatmap` to your pubspec:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_map: 0.14.0
  flutter_map_heatmap: any # or the latest version on Pub
```

Flutter heatmaps is implemented as a tile provider. 

Add it in your FlutterMap and configure it using `HeatMapOptions`.

```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlutterMap(
      options: new MapOptions(
          center: new LatLng(57.8827, -6.0400),
          zoom: 8.0
      ),
      layers: [
        new TileLayerOptions(
            urlTemplate: "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c']),
        HeatMapLayer(
          heatMapDataSource: InMemoryHeatMapDataSource(data: data),
          heatMapOptions: HeatMapOptions(),
          reset: _rebuildStream.stream,
        )
      ],
    );
  }
```

`InMemoryHeatMapDataSource` is provided out of the box but its easy to implement your own datasource 
provider by implementing `HeatMapDataSource`

## TODO
- [ ] complete GriddedHeatMapDataSource for gridding the data
- [ ] improve heatmaps at lower zoom levels by scaling the radius used during painting.
